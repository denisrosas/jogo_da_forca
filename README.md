Forca's game is a famous game in Brazil that you have to guess all the letters of a word.
Forca means gibbet in portuguese. The ideia is that if you guess wrong 5 times you die (or lose the game).

The code reads from countries.txt. It expect he first line to be a number of the words in the next lines.
It reads all words from the file and raffles one to be the secret word.
Then the user can start guessing letters that are on this word.
